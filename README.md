# data_storage

A Flutter project that collects data in several types and allow the user to see them as he want.

## Installing

### Supported Platforms

At the moment the only supported platform is **Android**.

The fact this project is built with Dart (and Flutter) makes the program crossplatform and this allow me to add simply other OS. For this in the future I want to add also _Linux_ and _Windows 11_ (may also Windows 10) support. Support for the Apple environment (_macOS_,  _iOS_ and _ipadOS_) will pontentially never added because I don't use any of them. However I want to try to add more support, but this will not do soon.

### Install on Android

Now _Android_ is the only supported system but this not mean that it's simple to install on it. This because the application is still in alpha.

However it's less difficult than install on other application, because you can download the built [`.apk` in the releases page](https://github.com/lucas27-01/data_storage/releases) or build the project from the source code.

### Install on other platforms

As already written the support for other platfrom doesn't exist officially, but you can still try to build yourself if you know how to do that.

_Any_ bug you will find on platform different from **Android** will not be fixed right away but could be useful for developers (only me now) in the future.
